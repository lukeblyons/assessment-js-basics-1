// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implmentation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the goal is to find out what is required of the developers and what is to be changed or developed. this is where the functional requirements of the software are defined."

const design = 'This is the third step, in which the goal is to curate how the app or website will look, as well as what code is needed to make this possible. This includessystem architexture, database design and the actual user interface design.'

const implementation = 'This is the fourth step, in which the goal is to actual write the code, creating software documentation and integrating outside software components.'

const testingAndIntegration = 'This is the fifth step, in which the goal is to test the software for bugs or errors, where the developement team can then fix them.'

const maintain = 'This is the sixth step, in which there is ongoing support for the software. This ensures that the software continues to be opporational and work as intended.'
